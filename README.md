# RESTful API for Recipes & Users Management

This is a Node.js & Express-based RESTful API for managing recipes, users, and categories.  
It uses **MongoDB Atlas** as the cloud database, and **JWT** for authentication.  
All endpoints return JSON responses and follow proper HTTP methods and status codes.


##  Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose
- JWT – authentication
- dotenv – environment variables
- Middleware – for error handling and authentication


##  Project Structure

- `models/` – Mongoose schemas for Users, Recipes, and Categories
- `routes/` – Express route handlers
- `controllers/` – Logic for each API call
- `middlewares/` – Custom middleware (auth, error handler)
- `config/` – Database connection

---

##  User Roles

- **Admin** – Full access
- **User** – Limited access to own data
- **Guest** – Registered but inactive (no access)


##  Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up `.env` file:
    ```env
    PORT=4200
    MONGODB_URI=***
    JWT_SECRET=***
    ```
4. Run the project: `npm start`
5. Use **Postman** or **Thunder Client** to test endpoints
